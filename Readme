This is a simple app that lets you add items to a Todo list and edit their titles.

Building
--------

**** Before you start please edit the TodoAPI.js file and change the userID constant to your email address. ****

To run the application on the HackerRank IDE:

1. From the menu select "Run/Install"
2. When step 1 is complete select "Run/Run"
3. You should now be able to open the app by clicking the preview button on the top right corner of the IDE.

Or if you are building it on your own computer:

- Run `npm install` in the project directory
- Run `npm run start` to build the app and start a server.
- You can access the app at http://127.0.0.1:8000

If all went well you should see a page with an "Add Todo" button. You should be able to reload the app and any changes you make should be persistent.

API
---

The application talks to a server using a simple REST API.

The JSON representation of the Todo items is

{
  id: string,
  title: string
}

The id is immutable and is generated by the server when the item is created.

GET /todos
Returns an array of Todo items

POST /todos/new
Creates a new Todo with the specified title. A unique id is generated by the server.
You'll notice that creation takes about 2 seconds.
Returns the new Todo

POST /todos/:todo
Updates a Todo item
You'll notice that an update takes about 2 seconds
Parameters:
  :todo - The id of the item to update
Returns the update item

DELETE /todos/:todo
Deletes a Todo item
Parameters:
  :todo - The id of the item to delete
